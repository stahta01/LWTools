>LWASM accepts plain text files in a relatively free form. It can handle
lines terminated with CR, LF, CRLF, or LFCR which means it should be able
to assemble files on any platform on which it compiles.</P
><P
>Each line may start with a symbol. If a symbol is present, there must not
be any whitespace preceding it. It is legal for a line to contain nothing
but a symbol.</P
><P
>The op code is separated from the symbol by whitespace. If there is
no symbol, there must be at least one white space character preceding it.
If applicable, the operand follows separated by whitespace. Following the
opcode and operand is an optional comment.</P
><P
> It is important to note that operands cannot contain any whitespace
except in the case of delimited strings.  This is because the first
whitespace character will be interpreted as the separator between the
operand column and the comment.  This behaviour is required for approximate
source compatibility with other 6x09 assemblers.  </P
><P
>A comment can also be introduced with a * or a ;. The comment character is
optional for end of statement comments. However, if a symbol is the only
thing present on the line other than the comment, the comment character is
mandatory to prevent the assembler from interpreting the comment as an opcode.</P
><P
>For compatibility with the output generated by some C preprocessors, LWASM
will also ignore lines that begin with a #. This should not be used as a general
comment character, however.</P
><P
>The opcode is not treated case sensitively. Neither are register names in
the operand fields. Symbols, however, are case sensitive.</P
><P
> As of version 2.6, LWASM supports files with line numbers.  If line
numbers are present, the line must start with a digit.  The line number
itself must consist only of digits.  The line number must then be followed
by either the end of the line or exactly one white space character.  After
that white space character, the lines are interpreted exactly as above. </P

>Portions of the source code can be excluded or included based on conditions
known at assembly time. Conditionals can be nested arbitrarily deeply. The
directives associated with conditional assembly are described in this section.</P
><P
>All conditionals must be fully bracketed. That is, every conditional
statement must eventually be followed by an ENDC at the same level of nesting.</P
><P
>Conditional expressions are only evaluated on the first assembly pass.
It is not possible to game the assembly process by having a conditional
change its value between assembly passes. Due to the underlying architecture
of LWASM, there is no possible utility to IFP1 and IFP2, nor can they, as of LWASM 3.0, actually
be implemented meaningfully. Thus there is not and never will
be any equivalent of IFP1 or IFP2 as provided by other assemblers. Use of those opcodes
will throw a warning and be ignored.</P
><P
>It is important to note that if a conditional does not resolve to a constant
during the first parsing pass, an error will be thrown. This is unavoidable because the assembler
must make a decision about which source to include and which source to exclude at this stage.
Thus, expressions that work normally elsewhere will not work for conditions.</P
